# NBAStatisticsProject
This project aims to explore the relationship between field goals attempted (FGA) and points per game (PPG) for the top 5 scoring players in the NBA. The project uses the NBA API to retrieve player statistics data and the scikit-learn library to fit a linear regression model to the data. The project then visualizes the data and model using matplotlib.

## Dependencies
This program requires the following dependencies:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- requests
- nba_api
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using the pip package manager:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install requests
pip install nba_api
pip install matplotlib
```

## Results
The project generates a graph that shows the relationship between FGA and PPG for the top 5 scoring players in the NBA. The graph also includes the linear regression line that fits the data, as well as the R-squared value of the model. The graph is saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the script.

## Acknowledgements
This project uses the NBA API to retrieve player statistics data. The API is provided by the NBA and is freely available for non-commercial use. The scikit-learn library is used to fit the linear regression model to the data, and the matplotlib library is used to visualize the data and model.
